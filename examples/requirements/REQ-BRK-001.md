# REQ-BRK-001: Emergency Braking Distance

## Description

The vehicle SHALL be capable of performing emergency braking from any velocity up to maximum design velocity, achieving deceleration according to the braking distance table parameters.

## Rationale

Emergency braking performance is critical for collision avoidance and overall vehicle safety. The braking distances are calculated based on:
- Maximum tire-road friction coefficients under various conditions
- Maximum allowable deceleration (passenger comfort and safety)
- System response time and actuator dynamics

## Acceptance Criteria

For each velocity and friction coefficient pair in the `braking_distance_table`:
1. Vehicle SHALL achieve full stop within specified distance Â±5%
2. Deceleration SHALL be smooth and controlled (no wheel lock)
3. Braking SHALL be repeatable across 100 consecutive tests

## Verification

- Brake dynamometer testing
- Proving ground testing on various surfaces (dry, wet, low friction)
- Automated emergency braking (AEB) system integration tests
- Tire friction coefficient measurement and validation

## Test Data

Expected test coverage:
- 30 km/h increments from 0 to maximum velocity
- Friction coefficients: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9
- Surface conditions: dry asphalt, wet asphalt, gravel, ice
